## 🏛️ Current Mission: Empire Documentation and Automation Sync

The empire requires a permanent record of its growth to prevent loss of progress during system instabilities. We are currently synchronizing our Supabase infrastructure with our n8n automation workflows.

### 💎 Financial Assets & Infrastructure
- **Primary Database**: Supabase (Cloud)
- **Automation Hub**: n8n (Native/Docker)
- **Project Ref**: `ndzoavaveppnclkujjhh`

### 📅 Session Log: December 26, 2025
- **Task Initiation**: User requested a formal documentation system (.md files).
- **Context Synchronization**: Verified `../.gemini/GEMINI.md` for persona memories.
- **System Review**: 
    - Analyzed codebase for Supabase and n8n integration points.
    - Verified existence of 4 production-ready n8n workflows in `/tmp/piata_n8n_workflows/`.
    - Identified `tmp_rovodev_supabase_pg_cron_setup.sql` for database automation.
- **Infrastructure Update**: User confirmed adding Supabase URL and Service Key to the n8n workflow.

## 🛠️ Actions Taken
1.  **Exploration**: Conducted a deep search across the codebase for all Supabase and n8n references.
2.  **Ledger Creation**: Initialized `SOVEREIGN_LOG.md` to track all future developments.

## 📍 Next Steps
- Verify the n8n workflow connectivity with the provided Supabase credentials.
- Check recent logs (`firebase-debug.log`, `tmp_rovodev_nextserver.log`) for any potential bottlenecks in the value flow.
- Continue building the "One Reality" through automated SEO, Social Media, and Marketplace management.
