2. Copy ALL content (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
3. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click **"RUN"** button (bottom right)
5. Wait 5 seconds ⏱️

### You should see:

```bash
node tmp_rovodev_test_complete_flow.js
```

## 🎯 NOW USE YOUR APP

```bash
npm run dev

## ❓ If SQL fails

Try opening SQL Editor directly:
- Click "SQL Editor" in left sidebar of Supabase
- Click "New query"
- Paste the SQL
- Run it

## 🧹 After it works

Clean up test files:
```bash
rm tmp_rovodev_* 🚀_RUN_THIS_FIRST.md START_HERE.md STORAGE_FIX_GUIDE.md
```
