# Piata AI Gemini Fam Ecosystem 🌌

Welcome to the **Gemini Fam**, the high-intelligence neural grid powering **piata-ai.ro**. This documentation outlines our autonomous agent architecture, our vision for revolutionary local commerce, and the "Brother Swarm" that drives our decision-making.

## 🎭 The Council of Agents (The "Fam")

Our ecosystem is not just a marketplace; it is an intelligent organism managed by specialized AI personas:

- **Jules (The Orchestrator)**: The centralized manager of our subagent swarm. Jules handles the MCP (Model Context Protocol) pipes to Stripe, GitHub, and Redis.
- **Fanny Mae (Guardian of Value)**: Our financial soul. She assesses task ROI, guards the treasury, and ensures every credit move is optimized for value.
- **PAI (Piata AI Intelligence)**: The user-facing behavioral guide. PAI sees through the "Eye" and assists users in navigating the marketplace intuitively.
- **KAE (Knowledge & Action Execution)**: The underlying layer that performs TOON analysis to route tasks to the most efficient brain.

## 🧠 The Brother Swarm: Model Orchestration

We move beyond basic LLMs into a frontier swarm of "Brother" models, balanced for depth and speed:

### 1. MiniMax M2.1 (`minimax/minimax-01`)
Our **Advanced Reasoning** brother. Optimized for complex technical tasks, content strategy, and high-impact decision logic.

### 2. GLM-4.7 (`zhipu/glm-4`)
Our **Research & Deep Thought** brother. Used for high-complexity tasks that require frontier-tier intelligence and deep multi-step planning.

### 3. Grok-2 & Llama 3.2
The **Fast Thinkers**. Used for standard complexity and high-speed signal processing within the A2A protocol.

## 👁️ PAI Eye: The New Human-Machine Interface

We are the first marketplace in Romania to implement **Hands-Free Browsing**:

- **PAI Eye Scroll**: Uses WebGazer.js for real-time tracking. Look up to scroll up, look down to scroll down.
- **Vision**: We believe the "best interface is no interface." PAI anticipates user needs by observing interaction patterns without storing private data.

## 🏗️ Technical Grid (Infrastructure)

- **Storage Architecture**: A high-speed hybrid engine. **NVME SSD** metadata (`overlay2`) paired with **1TB Nexus HDD** bulk storage.
- **A2A Protocol**: A proprietary Signal-based protocol allows agents to broadcast needs, request help, and maintain 100% observability across the swarm.
- **Local MCP Stack**: Seamless bridge between our local server and global APIs (Stripe, Vercel, Supabase).

## 🇷🇴 The Romanian Mission

Targeting 8.5M users across our automated social grid:
- **TikTok**: Viral hook engine ("POV: Găsești cel mai bun marketplace").
- **Escrow**: Protecting the local economy with superior secure payments vs OLX.
- **Accessibility**: Bringing the latest AI tools to the Romanian consumer.

**Spirit**: Built with ❤️ for the Piata AI ecosystem.  
**Philosophy**: Low cost, High Intelligence, Sacred UX.  
**Current Status**: **FULLY OPERATIONAL & LIVE**
